By the sea, fishing villages and cosmopolitan beaches with water sports set the pace of the day. And everywhere centuries old heritage proudly displays the history of the region. (...) There are flavours for every palate to comfort the stomach: cheese and sausages, bouillabaisses and roast suckling pig, honey and convent sweets; and for raising the spirits, you can rely on the excellent wines from the demarcated regions. They are all the product of the know-how of the people, who are genuinely welcoming in receiving their visitors with the best they have to offer."</p>
