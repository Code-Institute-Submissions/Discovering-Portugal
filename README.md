# Discovering Portugal

This website is thought to work mainly as a sort of digital turism guide giving tips and sugestions to anyone wishing to visit Portugal. Here you will not only find some of the best places to visit in Portugal, but also some of the things to see and tips as to where to stay and eat in each place.
 
## UX
 
This project is intended for turists and foreigns to discover more about Portugal and go visit it.

### User Stories
- As a turist, I want to get all the information about some of the best places to visit in Portugal, so that I can make the most of my visit.

### Strategy Plane
My goal in this website is to showcase some of the best places Portugal has to offer, as well as some tips and sugestions.

### Scope Plane
In order to make the site as simple and user friendly as possible I decided to divide Portugal in three main categories (the North, the Center and the South) where each of this categories will have its own webpage. In every one of those pages I put in a map of that area with the sugested places marked and under it you will find the name of the place with its photograph, a quote from a turistic website and some tips and sugestions for that place.

### Structure Plane
In terms of structure I created a homepage with an enticing image to represent Portugal. In this page the only things present are the title/name of the website and three navigation buttons to get you to the other pages.
The North, South and Center pages are all structured similarlly in order not to complicate overly much the website. Here you have a header with navigation links to the other pages, including the homepage, then a map section, after that a descriptive section about each place and finally a footer that again has navigation links (this way the user does not have to scroll back up to switch pages).

### Skeleton Plane
- Homepage wireframe
- North/Center/South page wireframe

### Surface Plane
How does my website look like and why?

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [Leaflet API](https://leafletjs.com/)


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
